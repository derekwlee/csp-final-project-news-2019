  <button class="collapsible">Ariana Grande Suffers From Tomato Allergies 5/30/19</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>On May 30th, household name Ariana Grande was forced to postpone all her shows in Florida for the week due to an allergic reaction. According to Grande, she had woken up with her throat almost closed, claiming it "still feels like I'm
    swallowing a cactus". On her Instagram, she reported that she ate tomatoes and suffered from a suddenly developed allergy.</p>
    <p>A sudden allergy to tomatoes in her mid-twenties? Also, isn't she Italian (yes, Ariana Grande is <i>not</i> Hispanic)? Board certified allergist and immunologist Katie Marks-Cogan weighs in on this new discovery, being a specialist in food allergies.
      Although it is very common for people to develop food allergies when they're children, it's entirely possible for you to develop a food alelrgy at any age. "A recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association based on a survey showed
      that 10 percent of adults likely have a food allergy and about 27 percent of them never had a food allergy as a child and only developed one as an adult," Marks-Cogan states. 
    <p>"We know that you can develop a food allergy at any time and that plenty of adults eat foods their whole life but then develop an allergy," Marks-Cogan adds. She says those seemingly sudden allergies could be caused by environmental or hormonal factors, 
      or caused by something called Pollen Food Syndrome (welcome to the club, Ariana!), which occurs when the immune system gets confused and thinks proteins in fresh foods and vegetables look like pollen from trees and grasses.
    <p>The type of reaction Grande appears to have had is more common with raw fruits and vegetables, Marks-Cogan says, as cooking tomatoes and other fresh produce breaks down and denatures the potentially troublesome proteins."Oral allergy syndrome is probably 
      more common than we think," she says, but "very few" adults are likely to develop a full-blown tomato allergy. Especially because eight foods or food groups make up 90 percent of all food allergies, including milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, shellfish, 
      fish and wheat, and, in an emerging concern, sesame allergy.
    <p>Grande's unexpected allergic reaction, which she joked in all caps was, "NOTHING MORE UNFAIR THAN AN ITALIAN WOMAN DEVELOPING AN ALLERGY TO TOMATOES IN HER MID TWENTIES," led to the postponement of Tuesday night's show at the Amalie Arena in Tampa and 
      Wednesday night's gig at the Amway Center in Orlando. Those shows have been rescheduled for, respectively, Nov. 24 and Nov. 25. At press time Grande was expected to resume the tour on Friday night (May 31) at the American Airlines Arena in Miami.

  <button class="collapsible">Kylie Jenner's Baby Stormi is Rushed to Hospital Following Allergic Reaction 6/3/19</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Kris Jenner revealed Kim Kardashian and Kanye West‘s 3-year-old son discovered he might be allergic to grass on a trip to Palm Springs.</p>
    <p>“Spent the day in the hospital with my baby,” Jenner, 21, captioned a photo of Stormi napping on her chest. “She had an allergic reaction but is 100% okay now and we are home.”
<p>The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star did not reveal what caused the reaction, but empathized with mothers whose kids are ill. She continued, “Nothing else matters when these things happen. God bless all the moms with sick babies. 
  I’m sending so much love and positive energy your way.”
<p>Less than two months ago, Jenner’s nephew Saint West was also in the hospital for an allergic reaction.

  <button class="collapsible">Why Researchers Suspect A Long Allergy Season 4/9/19</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>If you have seasonal allergies, you may have already suspected that allergy season is coming earlier, lasting longer and growing more severe in the last two decades. Now, there’s science to back up that hunch.
      <p>The upswing in allergens is a global phenomenon, reports Umair Irfan at Vox, with pollen counts increasing across the Northern Hemisphere in the last 20 years—an uptick likely fueled by climate change. And that’s a big deal; between 10 and 30 percent of the global population, 
      including 50 million Americans, suffer from seasonal allergies.
      <p>In a new study published in the journal The Lancet Planetary Health, researchers analyzed pollen counts in 17 locations worldwide stretching back an average of 20 years. Of those locations, 12 saw significant increases in the pollen load over time. The international team hypothesizes that the upswing in pollen is related to changes in maximum and minimum temperatures caused by climate change.
      <p>The intensification of allergy season is one of the earliest and most visible public health impacts of climate change, Irfan reports. “It’s very strong. In fact, I think there’s irrefutable data,” Jeffrey Demain, director of the Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Center of Alaska, not involved in the study, tells Vox’s Irfan. In Alaska, which is warming twice as fast as other parts of the globe, pollen is up as well as stings by insects.

    <button class="collapsible">Seasonal Allergies Linked to Climate Change 5/24/19</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>In 2010, AAFA and the National Wildlife Federation created a report about the impact of climate change on Americans with asthma and allergies. This report talks about how climate change will affect pollen, mold and poison ivy. More pollen, mold and poison ivy can increase the risks for asthma and allergy attacks. Climate change can also make air pollution worse. This can increase the risk and severity of asthma attacks.
      
    <p>Climate change is an environmental issue. It is also a serious threat to our public health.

<p>The government has a plan to address climate change and its health threat. Rising temperatures caused by climate change lead to longer allergy seasons and worsen air quality. Long allergy seasons can cause more allergies and asthma attacks.

<p>Between 1995 and 2011, warmer temperatures in the U.S. have caused the pollen season to be 11 to 27 days longer. These warmer temperatures create more pollen in the air, stronger airborne allergens and more allergy symptoms.</p>

  <button class="collapsible">Link Between Seasonal Allergies and Anxiety and Depression 5/29/19</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>A recently published review finds a significant link between hay fever and a raised risk of anxiety and depression in adolescents. They also appear to be more impulsive and have less resistance to stress.</p>
    <p>Allergies, such as hay fever, affect an estimated 50 million people in the United States.

<p>Although they are often considered fairly minor ailments, they can significantly impact the lives of those who live with them. Roughly 10–30 percent of the global population have hay fever, which is also called allergic rhinitis. And, in 2010, 11.1 million doctors' visits ended in a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. The most common symptoms, as many people will know first-hand, include a runny nose, itchy and watery eyes, sneezes and coughs, and fatigue.
<p>Although incredibly uncomfortable, a recent review digs a little deeper, finding links between hay fever and certain psychological issues in adolescents. This age group was of particular interest to the authors because they are a distinct and sometimes forgotten demographic; we should not "assume that adolescents are either big children or small adults," they write.
<p>The review — now published in the journal Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology — examined 25 previously published studies. The scientists were particularly interested in how hay fever impacts adolescents' quality of life. This includes emotional impact, disturbed sleep, and any interference with their schooling.
<p>It quickly became clear that hay fever's influence runs deeper than an itchy nose. "The emotional burden of hay fever can be huge for adolescents," says lead study author Dr. Michael Blaiss. He continues:
<p>"Three of the studies in our review examined how adolescents are emotionally affected by hay fever [...] and hay fever with eye allergies (allergic rhinoconjunctivitis). They found adolescents with hay fever had higher rates of anxiety and depression, and a lower resistance to stress. [They] also exhibited more hostility, impulsivity, and changed their minds often."
<p>Adolescents, it seems, are affected differently by hay fever than children or adults. Part of this is due to issues surrounding sleep, something that is vital for a host of essential functions, such as laying down new memories and enhancing creativity. "Lack of sleep or poor sleep are both huge issues for adolescents, and it can be made worse by the symptoms of hay fever with or without eye allergies. Poor sleep can have a negative impact on school attendance, performance, and academic achievement."
<p>Adolescence, for many individuals, contains a high volume of pivotal life events — such as learning to drive, taking exams, and making decisions about the future. People also become more autonomous and, perhaps, more concerned about the opinions of others.

<p>Hay fever has the potential to make some of these challenges even more challenging.The study authors hope that their findings will give doctors a better insight into the difficulties that some of their adolescent patients might be facing.
<p>As they conclude, "It is critical that clinicians gain a greater understanding of the unique burden of [allergic rhinitis] and [allergic rhinoconjunctivitis] in adolescents to ensure they receive prompt and appropriate care and treatment to improve clinical and academic outcomes."
